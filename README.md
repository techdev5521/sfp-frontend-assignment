# SFP Frontend Assesment

This repo was ~~forked from~~ inspired by https://gitlab.sfp.cc/sfp/sfp-frontend-assessment and serves only for review purposes.

### Next Steps
If I were to better this project, I would want to do the following:

- Implement a CSS preprocessor and automate grid creation
- Implement CSS within JSS for logical controls

### Usage
**1. Clone this repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/techdev5521/sfp-frontend-assesment.git
```

**2. Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

**3. Run the development server:**
```bash
npm run start
```

Not working? See the [create-react-app Docs](https://create-react-app.dev/).

### Notes
[This icon](https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/film-projector/) was used for a favicon.
[Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) was used for Photoshop file interaction.
Grid breakpoints were taken from [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/)
